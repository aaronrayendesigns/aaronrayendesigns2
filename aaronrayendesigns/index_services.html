            <h1>FREQUENT QUESTIONS</h1>
            <p><strong>Which is the method of payment?</strong><br>Payment will be made through Bizum, if you are a
                resident of Spain or Paypal if the payment would be
                international.<br><br><strong>How many changes can I make to the design?</strong><br>In the three services
                there are a total of 5 possible changes to improve the design to the client’s
                taste.<br><br><strong>How will I receive the files?</strong><br>Files shared before payment will be
                watermarked to protect copyright. When payment is made, all files
                will be sent through Google Drive to ensure that the content maintains quality. If this route is not
                possible, another solution would be sought.<br><br><strong>In what order will the payment be
                    made?</strong><br>Payment will be made once all the content is created and the client is satisfied
                with the result.<br><br><strong>How long will this service take?</strong><br>The duration of each service is
                stipulated on the previous pages, but the average duration is between
                1-3 weeks. Whether there are delays or advances, everything will be notified to the
                client.<br><br><strong>How do I contact you?</strong><br>The ideal is to have the conversation through
                Gmail, but if this is not possible, on the right, in the
                contact section, the platforms where you can contact me are shown.<br><br><strong>Once I have contracted
                    your service, what do I do?</strong><br>The first thing will be to fill out a form so that I, as a
                designer, can know the nature of your
                proposal and be able to design the perfect design for you. After this, designer and client will maintain
                contact to be able to show you the progress of the work and be able to establish the necessary changes.
                Once the options are finished, it will be decided which one is indicated and the files will be sent for
                the client’s satisfaction.</p>
